# CAP-3618

## Computational Analysis of Social Complexity

Welcome to the inagural running of the CAP-3618 course!

This course is designed to introduce students to the key theoretical and practical (programming) concepts necessary to answer meaninful questions about the connections we observe and are a part of in the world around us.

We will blend concepts from graph theory, social networks, natural language processing, economics, game theory, and blockchain + smart contracts.

With all that is going on in the world right now -- from COVID to Twitter and politics to crypto currencies -- this is an ideal time to study these exciting topics.
