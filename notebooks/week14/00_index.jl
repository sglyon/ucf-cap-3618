Welcome to week 13!

This week we will continue studying blockchains.

We will build on our knowledge of the Ethereum blockchain and its virutal machine (the Ethereum virtual machine or EVM). We will study the field of decentralized finance (defi) and see how the ERC-20 tokens makes the entire Defi ecosystem work like a set of building blocks.

You can find the jupyter notebook for today's lecture <a href="https://github.com/sglyon/ucf-cap-6318/blob/Fall21/notebooks/week14/01-defi.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>
