Welcome to week 7!

This week we pivot to a new topic and discuss simulation methods and agent based models. We'll learn how rather complex interactions can be modeled using a large number of somewhat simple "agents".

We'll really lean into our Julia programming experience, so brushing up on those skills will be helpful.

**Reading** We'll be using Agents.jl, so looking at its [documentation and tutorials](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/) would be a good idea.
