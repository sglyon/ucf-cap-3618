> Computational Analysis of Social Complexity
>
> Fall 2021, Spencer Lyon

Welcome to week 1!

This week we will get to know eachother and get on the same page with respect to what this class is all about.

We will also dive right in to the computational infrastructure we will need by installing the Julia programming langauge and learning a bit about how to use it.

Finally, we'll finish by talking about Graphs (networks) and cover some of the core theory.
