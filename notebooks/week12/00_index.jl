Welcome to week 12!

This week we will begin studying our final major topic of the course: blockchains

Blockchains are a very exciting, but somewhat complex topic

In this first lecture we will try to provide motivations for why we should care about blockchains, how they are made, what cryptocurrencies are, and possible applications for blockchain technology

We will also present the bulk of this lecture via a Jupyter notebook. The reason for this is that you should be working on your projects now and you are allowed to use either Pluto or Jupyter notebooks and I wanted to show how we can use Julia from Jupyter.

You can find the jupyter notebook for today's lecture <a href="https://github.com/sglyon/ucf-cap-6318/blob/Fall21/notebooks/week12/01_intro_to_blockchains.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>
