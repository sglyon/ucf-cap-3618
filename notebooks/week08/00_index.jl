Welcome to week 8!

This week we will continue studying agent based models and simulation. We will use the Agents.jl [documentation and tutorials](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/) as case studies to help us practice our Julia and ABM skills.

**Reading** We'll be using Agents.jl, so looking at its [documentation and tutorials](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/) would be a good idea.
