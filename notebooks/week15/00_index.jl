Welcome to week 15! This is it -- our last lecture. Today we will finish up our introduction to blockchains by studying the ERC-721 token standard -- also known as NFTs.

NFTs are a very rapidly expanding application of blockchain technology. Be sure to keep an eye on this space in the coming months/years as the world is still figuring out just how the NFT concept can be applied in a wide variety of arenas.

You can find the jupyter notebook for today's lecture <a href="https://github.com/sglyon/ucf-cap-6318/blob/Fall21/notebooks/week15/01-nft.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>
